What key components are necessary to create a technology hub according to Paul Graham?,The key components to create a technology hub are rich people and nerds.,"('According to Paul Graham, to create a technology hub, it is important to attract nerds by providing the right personality in a town. Nerds are a distinct subset of the creative class that are not influenced by glamour but by the presence of other smart people. Therefore, towns that can appeal to nerds do not have to be glamorous or expensive; they need to be places where smart people want to stay and are genuinely happy【11†source】. Additionally, a technology hub can resist and perhaps even surpass areas like Silicon Valley by exerting enough pull over the right people. This may involve avoiding common pitfalls like excessive suburban sprawl, which is seen as a key weakness of Silicon Valley despite its successes【15†source】.', ['If you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with personality. You need a town with the right personality. Nerds are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes from the rest. You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. [5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling. This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York, where people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in Boston, a friend came to visit from New York. On the subway back from the airport she asked ""Why is everyone smiling?"" I looked and they weren\'t smiling. They just looked like they were compared to the facial expressions she was used to. If you\'ve lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions come from. It\'s the kind of place where your mind may be excited, but your body knows it\'s having a bad time. People don\'t so much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement. And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable. It\'s a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame. Nerds don\'t care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery. People who like New York will pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the cool people are really cool. A nerd looks at that deal and sees only: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment. Nerds will pay a premium to live in a town where the smart people are really smart, but you don\'t have to pay as much for that. It\'s supply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for it', 'So a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley. For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot'])",[],4.0

How are people classified according to their degree and aggressiveness of conformism?,"People are classified into four types based on their degree and aggressiveness of conformism: aggressively conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.","('People can be classified according to their degree and aggressiveness of conformism using a Cartesian coordinate system with two axes: one horizontal axis representing a spectrum from conventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and one vertical axis from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. This system describes four types of people:\n\n1. Aggressively conventional-minded: These individuals are depicted as tattletales, believing not only that rules must be followed but that those who break them should be punished.\n2. Passively conventional-minded: Referred to as the sheep, they obey the rules but do not necessarily feel a need to ensure that others do as well; they may worry about others being punished for breaking rules.\n3. Passively independent-minded: Represented as the dreamy ones, they do not particularly care about rules and are not always clear on what the rules are.\n4. Aggressively independent-minded: Described as naughty, they are inclined to question rules and do the opposite of what they are told.\n\nPaul Graham notes that all four types can be found in most societies and that which quadrant people fall into relies more on their own personality than the societal norms. However, not all types are equally common. He points out that there are more passive people than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded than independent-minded individuals. Hence, the passively conventional-minded represent the largest group, while the aggressively independent-minded are the smallest【7†source】.', ['Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded. I think that you\'ll find all four types in most societies, and that which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality than the beliefs prevalent in their society. [1]Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points. Anyone who\'s been to primary school has seen the four types, and the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules. The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded ones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must be obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished. The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded, are the sheep. They\'re careful to obey the rules, but when other kids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be punished, not to ensure that they will. The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded, are the dreamy ones. They don\'t care much about rules and probably aren\'t 100% sure what the rules even are. And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively independent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule, their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to do makes them inclined to do the opposite. When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect to what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it\'s the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school rules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite. In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive calls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call of the aggressively conventional-minded is ""Crush <outgroup>!"" (It\'s rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but that\'s the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.) The call of the passively conventional-minded is ""What will the neighbors think?"" The call of the passively independent-minded is ""To each his own."" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded is ""Eppur si muove.""The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than independent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the smallest'])",[],5.0
What is the main danger of restricting the discussion of certain ideas?,"Restricting the discussion of certain ideas is dangerous because it not only affects the topics targeted by the restrictions but also propagates back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden areas, potentially stifling innovation and free thought.","('The main danger of restricting the discussion of certain ideas, according to Paul Graham, is twofold:\n\n1. **The Fallibility of the Banning Process**: Any system designed to determine which ideas to ban is likely to make mistakes, especially as intelligent people generally avoid undertaking the work of censorship, leaving it to those less capable. Consequently, there is a need for a margin of error, demanding that fewer ideas be banned in order to account for these mistakes. However, those who are aggressively conventional-minded and enjoy seeing punishment doled out or are in competition with each other for moral purity may push to ban as many ideas as possible, leading to a situation where virtually any idea that could be seen as ban-worthy is prohibited, leaving no margin for error.\n\n2. **The Interconnectedness of Ideas**: Banning certain topics doesn\'t just isolate those specific ideas; it affects the broader discussion as the restrictions spread to any topic that could lead to conclusions in the banned areas. Ideas often have implications and consequences that span multiple fields, so when some ideas are banned, the overall space of free inquiry is suppressed. The dynamic of discussion becomes constrained and cautious, much like a soccer game played with a minefield in one corner of the pitch; even the ""safe"" areas become less open to robust play out of fear and restriction【7†source】.', ['There are two reasons why we need to be able to discuss even ""bad"" ideas. The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is bound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligent wants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done by the stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you need to leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need to ban fewer ideas than you\'d like to. But that\'s hard for the aggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoy seeing people punished, as they have since they were children, and partly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxy can\'t allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives other enforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department, and perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of getting the margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to the bottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up being banned. [4]The second reason it\'s dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn\'t only affect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge case. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences in fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world where some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that has a minefield in one corner. You don\'t just play the same game you would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much more subdued game even on the ground that\'s safe'])",[],5.0
What was the long-term goal of Airbnb as explained to potential investors?,"Airbnb's long-term goal was to become the market in accommodation, similar to how eBay is for stuff.","(""The long-term goal of Airbnb was not explicitly detailed in terms of what they communicated to potential investors at the early stages depicted in the essay. However, Paul Graham does provide insight into the motivations and attitudes of the Airbnb founders during their time with Y Combinator, which can be indicative of their long-term vision.\n\nAccording to the essay, the Airbnb founders were motivated by more than just making money; they were driven by the experience they had as hosts themselves. They enjoyed hosting guests and saw the potential for a new way for hosts to make money and for guests to travel, suggesting their long-term goal was to tap into and expand this new market【9†source】. \n\nThey didn't give up because they believed in the new way of traveling and hosting they had experienced. Their actions, such as making enough money to reach ramen profitability ($4000 a month) and concentrating on New York to improve and grow their listings, demonstrate their commitment to creating a sustainable business model that provided real value to both guests and hosts.\n\nWhile the document does not contain a direct quote of their explained long-term goals to investors, it implies that their intent was to create a marketplace that could transform the way people travel and host, creating value during what was the worst recession in decades."", ['During the batch our nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the cartoon character he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested an idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them they\'d not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new ideas they had in the process. ""They probably have the best attitude of any startup we\'ve funded"" I wrote to Mike Arrington during the batch. They\'re still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the summer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is ten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things Airbnb could do. What we didn\'t realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was that Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for a year and getting no growth, they\'d agreed to give it one last shot. They\'d try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still didn\'t take off, they\'d give up. Any normal person would have given up already. They\'d been funding the company with credit cards. They had a binder full of credit cards they\'d maxed out. Investors didn\'t think much of the idea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of meeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but he never came back. ""He didn\'t even finish his smoothie,"" Brian said. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades. The stock market was in free fall and wouldn\'t hit bottom for another four months. Why hadn\'t they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People, like matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing that\'s clear is that they weren\'t doing this just for the money. As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year\'s work and all they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit cards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because of the experience they\'d had as the first hosts. When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a design convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money to pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened: they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they\'d all had a great experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts, a new way to make money that had literally been right under their noses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways better than hotels. That experience was why the Airbnbs didn\'t give up. They taped this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment. The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus on the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started there, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where there was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So they focused on New York. They went there in person to visit their hosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part of that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional camera and took pictures of the hosts\' places themselves. This didn\'t just make the listings better. It also taught them about their hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York, I asked what they\'d noticed about hosts that surprised them, and they said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in the same position they\'d been in: they needed this money to pay their rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and it had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs\' sense of mission to feel that people needed them. In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their efforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward. But it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just random fluctuation'])",[],2.0

What is the outcome of American companies letting focus groups design their cars?,"American cars continue to lose market share because the customer does not truly want what they think they want, and focus groups fail to capture the essence of good design that sophisticated buyers seek.","(""The outcome of American companies letting focus groups design their cars is negative in the long term.

Why do venture capitalists tend to be conservative when investing in startups?,"Venture capitalists are often conservative because the large size of their investments makes them cautious, they are investing other people's money which heightens their fear of making risky decisions, and many are not technical experts, so they don't fully understand the innovations behind the startups they invest in.","(""Venture capitalists (VCs) are typically conservative when investing in startups for several reasons, based on Paul Graham's explanation:\n\n1. **Investment Size and Control**: VCs usually invest significant amounts of money—often $1 million or more—and the transition from an angel round to a Series A round with VCs often results in founders losing some control of their company【9†source】.\n\n2. **Due Diligence**: VCs can only do a limited number of deals each year, thus they are careful about their investments. This has traditionally led to a lengthy and stressful due diligence process that can take weeks or months【9†source】.\n\n3. **Market Gap Response**: Before the advent of super-angels investors, there was a gap between what angels and VCs would invest. This made it challenging for startups that needed more than what angels could provide but less than the typical minimum that VCs were looking to invest. However, this gap is being filled by super-angels who are willing to invest in amounts that are smaller than typical VCs but larger than traditional angel investors【9†source】.\n\n4. **Brand and Value-Adding Capabilities**: Established VC firms have stronger brands and can provide more value to their portfolio companies beyond just capital, like advice and access to networks. This encourages them to invest in companies where they believe they can significantly contribute to success and demand higher returns on their investments【9†source】.\n\n5. **Focused Investment for Higher Returns**: Since the distribution of startup outcomes is uneven, VCs might be more calculated and prefer fewer, larger bets on potential big winners rather than spreading their investments thinly across a larger number of startups. By doing so, they aim to capture the outsized returns that occasionally come from investing in a company that becomes hugely successful【9†source】.\n\nThese points suggest that VCs are conservative because they seek to balance the risk of their large investments with the potential for high returns, while also providing substantial value-add to the companies in which they invest. The introduction of super-angels has begun challenging some of these conventions, but VCs remain judicious in their selection process to secure their investment goals."", [""There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs. Angels would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more. So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million. The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted to raise. Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise around $400k. But it was a pain to stitch together that much out of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments so small. That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. They're responding to the market. The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups, because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one another. Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs. That's going to change the rules about how to raise money. I don't know yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes will be for the better. A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of the qualities of a VC. They're usually individuals, like angels. In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of the classic type. But like VCs, they invest other people's money. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels: a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k. They make investment decisions quickly, like angels. And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many. The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs. They don't just compete for startups; they also compete for investors. What super-angels really are is a new form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund. After an angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the company, whereas after a series A round they often don't. The traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders, two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person. Plus series A terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including selling the company. Founders usually have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things are going well. But that's not the same as just being able to do what you want, like you could before. A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that they're less stressful to raise. Raising a traditional series A round has in the past taken weeks, if not months.

What is the fundamental reason there aren't more companies like Google?,"The fundamental reason there aren't more companies like Google is that the most innovative startups are undervalued by those with the funds, leading to a lack of sufficient early investment.","(""Paul Graham suggests that there aren't more companies like Google primarily because Venture Capitalists (VCs) undervalue the most innovative startups. He explains that often, investors are not encouraging innovative companies to sell out; instead, they just don't fund them. Many VCs are more conservative than they appear and are hesitant to invest in very novel ideas, which are perceived as riskier bets. As a result, they miss out on potential high-growth opportunities like Google and Facebook, which have remained independent because they were undervalued by acquirers and persisted in their vision【7†source】."", [""Why There Aren't More Googles\n\nApril 2008\n\nWant to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. Umair Haque wrote recently that the reason there aren't more Googles is that most startups get bought before they can change the world. Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo—what must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time—didn't sell out. Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or MSN's search box. Why isn't it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose: a conviction to change the world for the better. This has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true. Google's founders were willing to sell early on. They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay. It was the same with Facebook. They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it by offering too little. Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising your offer, because there's a good chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain. [1]From the evidence I've seen so far, startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better. Not always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or perhaps even an IPO. Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue startups. More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very successful. That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup. While I'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent: acquirers underestimated them. Corporate M&A is a strange business in that respect. They consistently lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make it big. VCsSo what's the real reason there aren't more Googles? Curiously enough, it's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups. The reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage innovative startups to sell out, but that they won't even fund them. I've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them. The most surprising thing I've learned is how conservative they are. VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation. Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in reality than you'd guess from reading their sites. I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous. On closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats. They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at least), but less bold. Maybe the VC industry has changed. Maybe they used to be bolder. But I suspect it's the startup world that has changed, not them""])",[],4.0

How does the creation of wealth differ from the accumulation of wealth through corrupt means historically?,"Historically, wealth accumulation often occurred through appropriation, whereas the creation of wealth became prominent with the rise of the middle class and the Industrial Revolution, where wealth was generated.","(""Historically, the accumulation of wealth often occurred through what might be termed corrupt means. For most of human history, the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it. This could involve cattle raiding in pastoral societies, appropriating others' estates during times of war, or taxing them in times of peace. Wealth was often not created but taken from others through the use of power or position, as when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to his followers or when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries. In more organized societies, such as ancient China, the wealth of rulers and officials came not from creating it but from serving a ruler powerful enough to appropriate wealth through taxation or confiscation.\n\nThe creation of wealth as a contrasting concept began to emerge with the rise of the middle class in Europe. Originally, the middle class was a distinct group in a feudal society, which was composed of a warrior aristocracy and serfs working their estates. This novel middle class, emerging around the tenth and eleventh centuries, consisted of individuals living in towns and supporting themselves through manufacturing and trade. Unlike serfs, who had limited incentive to create wealth since it belonged to their masters, the middle class had the independence to keep the wealth they created, providing a substantial incentive to produce more.\n\nThe change towards wealth creation continued to grow and it was not until the Industrial Revolution that creating wealth definitively replaced corruption as the main path to becoming rich. Corruption began to be seen unfavorably, and it started to be identified and called out as corruption only when there were other, faster, and more legitimate ways to accumulate wealth. By the nineteenth century, the dynamic had shifted; wealth was now being created more through industry and commerce than through corrupt practices. Political positions were increasingly filled by those driven by vanity rather than greed, and technology had advanced to the point where creating wealth was actually faster than trying to steal it【7†source】."", ['Stealing ItThe second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding; in agricultural societies by appropriating others\' estates in times of war, and taxing them in times of peace. In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates confiscated from the losers. In England in the 1060s, when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to his followers, the conflict was military. By the 1530s, when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers, it was mostly political. [9] But the principle was the same. Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe. In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials used taxation instead of confiscation. But here too we see the same principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it. This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade. Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords. [10] Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making more than you could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created. Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly. Nearly everything we have was created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class. (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called ""corruption"") when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich. Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office was a recognized route to wealth. The great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would now call corruption than from commerce. [11] By the nineteenth century that had changed. There continued to be bribes, as there still are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who were driven more by vanity than greed'])",[],5.0

Not all startups would grow as large as Google, but given the number some might come close. These founders would not be taking jobs from Americans, but rather creating new ones, as the startups they establish would hire employees as they grow. As part of the terms of the visa, these founders would be unable to work for existing companies, only for the new ones they establish.\n\nThe introduction of a new class of visa specifically for startup founders could have a direct effect on creating more job opportunities for the domestic workforce, as these startups grow and expand their operations. This policy could lead to a large increase in the pool of startup founders and have a visible effect on the economy, potentially making it a notable legislative achievement【7†source】.', [""The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.

It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country. Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy. If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies. Each year. They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close. By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.

Therefore, smaller organizations prioritize actual performance over credentials. Larger organizations, on the other hand, often operate under the belief that elite pedigrees predict performance, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy within the culture of the company. In a world of small organizations, performance is the primary concern, rather than where someone went to college or whether they graduated at all【7†source】."", [""As organizations get smaller, this approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.

What should students focus on in college to become proficient hackers?,"Students should focus on getting very good at programming and learning a lot about specific, cool problems.","('To become proficient hackers, Paul Graham suggests that students in college should focus on certain academic departments and practical skills:\n\n1. Academically, the worthwhile departments include math, the hard sciences, engineering, history (particularly economic and social history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics【9†source】.\n\n2. While modern literature is important, Graham advises simply reading as the best way to learn about it. Courses in art history may be beneficial, and for subjects like studio art and creative writing, value can be found especially if you have a good teacher【10†source】.\n\n3. In terms of preparing for a job, what students should learn depends on the type of job they desire. Graham points out that the skills mastered in college may not be directly correlated to the job, but that aiming slightly higher provides mental training similar to an athlete training with heavier weights than required by their sport【11†source】.\n\n4. Graham also emphasizes the discrepancy between class assignments and real-world programming. To bridge this gap, he suggests engaging with larger, real-world codebases and recommends contributing to open-source projects and starting personal projects to gain the experience employers value. This helps students learn how to deal with existing code and decide what problems need solving【12†source】.\n\n5. Graham further advises tackling problems that students personally encounter, giving the example of his development of a spam filtering algorithm as a response to his own need to stop getting spam【13†source】.\n\nIn summary, Graham advocates for a balance between theoretical knowledge from rigorous academic disciplines and practical experience garnered from personal projects and contributions to open-source software.', ['The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hard sciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics.

This can be a signal to students that the professors at such institutions are likely to be engaging in research that is worth their time and effort.

How does a wealth tax differ from income tax in terms of its application to assets or income?,"A wealth tax is applied to the same asset repeatedly over time, while income tax is only applied to the income of that particular year.","(""A wealth tax differs from an income tax in that it is applied not to the income earned each year, but rather to the total value of a person's assets. For example, a wealth tax of 1% means an individual gets to keep 99% of their stock each year. Over an extended period, such as 60 years, a seemingly modest wealth tax can result in a substantial portion of assets being taxed away. This is because, unlike income tax which is applied only to that year's income, a wealth tax is applied to the same assets repeatedly every year, which has a compounding effect. For instance, with a 1% wealth tax, the government will, over the course of 60 years, take 45% of the stock of a startup founder. If the wealth tax has a threshold (such as only applying to wealth above a certain amount), then the impact might be somewhat reduced but would still be significant over many years due to its repetitive application to the same assets【11†source】."", [""Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in addition to income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of various levels of wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startup founder. Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then live for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume?If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to calculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will over the course of your life take 45% of your stock.(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming net poorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)Here's how much stock the government would take over 60 years at various levels of wealth tax: wealth taxgovernment takes 0.1%6%0.5%26% 1.0%45% 2.0%70% 3.0%84% 4.0%91%5.0%95% A wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts. How much difference would a high threshold make? To model that, we need to make some assumptions about the initial value of your stock and the growth rate. Suppose your stock is initially worth $2 million, and the company's trajectory is as follows: the value of your stock grows 3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years, then 50% for 2 years, after which you just get a typical public company growth rate, which we'll call 8% [1] Suppose the wealth tax threshold is $50 million.

A 2% wealth tax with a $50 million threshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder's stock. The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year's income.

What factors contributed to Silicon Valley and Seattle becoming major tech centers?,"Silicon Valley became a tech center because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto and the experts he lured west liked it so much they stayed, while Seattle became a tech center because Gates and Allen wanted to move back home.","('Silicon Valley and Seattle became major tech centers due to a combination of factors that include a culture that tolerates and encourages the exploration of odd and new ideas, a socio-political climate that is liberal and open to unconventional thinking, and the presence of vibrant city centers attractive to young professionals. According to Paul Graham, most successful startup ideas initially seem a little crazy, and cities that embrace this kind of creative thinking, which often comes with a liberal mentality, are more likely to become startup hubs. This is because smart people, who are vital to innovation, typically have unconventional ideas that are best nurtured in open-minded environments.\n\nMoreover, having an intact city center has played a crucial role. For example, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle are mentioned as startup hubs with such vibrant city centers that attract young people who prefer to live in dynamic urban areas rather than the suburbs. This is contrasted with the growth patterns of other American cities where the center has been abandoned for suburban development, which is not conducive to the growth of startup culture.\n\nSpecifically for Silicon Valley, its origins can be traced back to William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor, who started Shockley Semiconductor in Palo Alto in 1956. The city was a charming college town with great weather and proximity to San Francisco, which made it an attractive place for startups. Startups tend to beget more startups, creating a cycle of innovation and entrepreneurship. People who work for startups often go on to start their own, and those who profit from them frequently invest in new ventures. This organic growth, linked to the initial decision by Shockley to move to Palo Alto, was crucial, and all the major companies in Silicon Valley are connected in various ways to Shockley Semiconductor, forming a network of innovation and expertise necessary for the establishment of a tech hub【7†source】.', ['tolerates oddness in the search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because economically that\'s what startups are. Most good startup ideas seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone would have done them already.(How many people are going to want computers in their houses? What, another search engine?)That\'s the connection between technology and liberalism. Without exception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal. But it\'s not because liberals are smarter that this is so. It\'s because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by definition have odd ideas. Conversely, a town that gets praised for being ""solid"" or representing ""traditional values"" may be a fine place to live, but it\'s never going to succeed as a startup hub. The 2004 presidential election, though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with a county-by-county map of such places. [6]To attract the young, a town must have an intact center. In most American cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if any, is in the suburbs. Most American cities have been turned inside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle. They all have intact centers. [7] My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a startup hub. Young people don\'t want to live in the suburbs. Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned into new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland. Both have the kind of effervescent feel that attracts the young. They\'re each only a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if they wanted to. TimeA great university near an attractive town. Is that all it takes? That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor. He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved to Palo Alto to do it. At the time that was an odd thing to do. Why did he? Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was. Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming college town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and San Francisco only an hour away. The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in various ways from Shockley Semiconductor. Shockley was a difficult man, and in 1957 his top people-- ""the traitorous eight""-- left to start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor. Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins. Forty-two years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel.

Why do startups not spread as quickly and widely as industrialization did historically?,"Startups do not spread as efficiently because they are more of a social phenomenon and don't rely on geography, needing a community of expertise, unlike how individual European manufacturers could import industrial techniques and they would work fine.","(""Startups tend not to spread as quickly and widely as industrialization historically because they are more of a social than a technical phenomenon, and are also not tied to specific geographic features【7†source】.

What prompted some readers to want to understand the specific technical advantages of using Lisp in Viaweb?,"A link to ""Beating the Averages"" being posted on Slashdot incited readers' curiosity.","(""The specific technical advantages of using Lisp in Viaweb prompted some readers to want to understand more about the language because of the significant benefits it provided in the development process and its impact on the competitiveness of the software. The use of Lisp was seen as an experiment by Viaweb, under the hypothesis that it would enable them to develop features faster than competitors and implement functionalities that were not easily achieved in other programming languages【7†source】.\n\nOne specific advantage was the substantial portion of the Viaweb editor's source code that consisted of macros—around 20-25%—which are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions and are used to perform tasks that are difficult to do in other languages. This unique feature of Lisp allowed Viaweb to put technical barriers between themselves and their competitors and to create software that could accomplish things their competitors' software could not【8†source】.\n\nMoreover, the choice of Lisp helped Viaweb achieve rapid development, a critical factor in a market where getting new features done quickly was an important competitive edge. Viaweb's use of Lisp meant they did not require a large development team, which kept costs low. They could release software the instant it was completed, often replicating new competitor features within days, giving the impression that they had a secret weapon【7†source】. These technical benefits of Lisp were leveraged to use technology that competitors, typically using more median languages, could not match【9†source】."", [""We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it's done. If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take. So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway. What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn't have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too. It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized"", ""But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% macros. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other language. However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him curious. We weren't writing this code for our own amusement. We were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to put technical barriers between us and our competitors. A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some correlation here. A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages. The resulting software did things our competitors' software couldn't do"", ""We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it's done. If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take. So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway. What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn't have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too. It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized"", 'you can use technology that your competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be able to match'])",[],4.0

What is meant by the concept of 'alien truth'?,"'Alien truth' refers to the most general truths that humans could share with any form of intelligent life, going beyond the realms of math or physics.","(""The concept of 'alien truth' as defined by Paul Graham refers to truths that would be shared between humans and intelligent beings from elsewhere in the universe, beyond the universally accepted truths of mathematics and physics. Graham suggests that principles like the validity of controlled experiments, the idea that practice improves skill, and Occam's razor would likely be considered 'alien truths' because there is nothing inherently human about them; they could plausibly be relevant to alien intelligence.\n\nThe idea of alien truth also serves as a threshold or target for finding the most general truths. It is suggested that the search for alien truth should be a part of the field of philosophy or even serve as a definition of what the field should strive to do: find the most general and widely applicable truths. Graham believes that this search is a worthwhile undertaking and that, in the future, it may even converge with artificial intelligence research to be more precise about what constitutes truths for an intelligent being. Interestingly, Graham observes that the notion that seeking alien truths is itself probably an example of an alien truth【7†source】."", ['Alien Truth\n\nOctober 2022\n\nIf there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they\'d share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics would be the same, because they\'re true by definition. Ditto for the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same on their planet. But I think we\'d share other truths with aliens besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be worthwhile to think about what these might be. For example, I think we\'d share the principle that a controlled experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally increased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing. We\'d probably share Occam\'s razor. There doesn\'t seem anything specifically human about any of these ideas. We can only guess, of course. We can\'t say for sure what forms intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth. If you\'re trying to find the most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably they\'ll be those we\'d share in common with other forms of intelligent life. Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of generosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that\'s enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn\'t want to bet that all intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I wouldn\'t want to bet against it either. The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos\'s idea of God\'s book. He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God\'s book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be universally recognized. If there\'s such a thing as alien truth, then there\'s more in God\'s book than math. What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice is ""philosophy."" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should probably include this. I\'m fairly sure Aristotle would have thought so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth is, if not an accurate description of philosophy, a good definition for it. I. e. that it\'s what people who call themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently are. But I\'m not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what we call it. We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what truths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might find, for example, that it\'s impossible to create something we\'d consider intelligent that doesn\'t use Occam\'s razor. We might one day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research would be very interesting, it\'s not necessary for our purposes, or even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we\'re going to call it that, would be to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target, not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one day converge, but they\'ll converge from quite different directions, and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves to thinking only about things we\'re certain would be alien truths. Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let\'s see if that one does.)Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be a worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself probably an alien truth'])",[],5.0

Graham continues to suggest that if startups could reach profitability with minimal investment, as Ticketstumbler did with just a $15,000 investment from Y Combinator, they may prefer not to raise additional funds from VCs. This change in approach among founders could lead to a scenario where highly successful companies might not take VC funding at all, which could have a significant impact on the traditional VC business model【15†source】.', [""If founders decide VCs aren't worth the trouble, that could be bad for VCs.

They all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them. If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it. And the same is true for funding.

What type of intelligence is particularly valuable in the startup world?,"Imagination is the type of intelligence that is most valuable, as it allows for the creation of surprising new ideas which may initially seem unconventional.","('In the startup world, a particularly valuable type of intelligence is the ability to focus narrowly on optimizing for growth, akin to the way one might optimize code for performance. As Paul Graham describes, this focus on achieving a target growth rate simplifies the complex problem of starting a startup into a single, clear objective. Decisions become easier because anything that helps the startup reach its growth target is considered the right move. This type of single-mindedness can be very effective; it forces founders to act decisively and frequently leads to innovative solutions, and it might even guide the startup in directions the founders had not initially anticipated, potentially leading to better ideas and outcomes【15†source】.', [""We're turning starting a startup into an optimization problem. And anyone who has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort of narrow focus can be. Optimizing code means taking an existing program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or memory. You don't have to think about what the program should do, just make it faster. For most programmers this is very satisfying work. The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're generally surprised how fast you can solve it. Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem. You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right. Should you spend two days at a conference? Should you hire another programmer? Should you focus more on marketing? Should you spend time courting some big customer? Should you add x feature? Whatever gets you your target growth rate. [8]Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more than a week ahead. Once you experience the pain of missing your target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such pain in the future. So you'll be willing for example to hire another programmer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you more users. But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers without hiring someone new. It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think about it no more than necessary. In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into trouble. They could end up on a local maximum. But in practice that never happens. Having to hit a growth number every week forces founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of succeeding. Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is just a form of procrastination. Whereas founders' intuitions about which hill to climb are usually better than they realize. Plus the maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones. The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can actually discover startup ideas. You can use the need for growth as a form of evolutionary pressure. If you start out with some initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10% weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than you meant to start""])",[],2.0

What are the two senses in which work can be considered one's own?,"Work can be considered one's own if it is being done voluntarily rather than because someone told you to do it, and if it is being done by oneself.","(""The two senses in which work can be considered one's own, according to Paul Graham's essay, are:\n\n1) You're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to. This sense of ownership over work is quite sharp as people who care about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between being pulled towards work that excites them and being pushed into work by external forces.\n   \n2) You're doing it by yourself, as opposed to collaborating with others. This sense of ownership has a much softer edge because it can gradually shade into collaboration. Interestingly, collaboration itself can happen in two ways: firstly, multiple people can share a single project such as two mathematicians working together on a proof; secondly, people can work on separate parts of a collective project that fit together, like an author writing a book and another person designing the graphics【7†source】."", [""There turn out to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself. The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do something. You can choose to do something you're told to do. Indeed, you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to do it. For example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set of problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all of them. The other sense of a project being one's own — working on it by oneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually into collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in two different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one person writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design. [3]These two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But under the right conditions, the excitement of working on a project of one's own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegrating into the turbulent flow of work in a large organization""])",[],5.0
What is one attribute that has contributed to investor Ron Conway's success in the startup world?,"Being genuinely good has contributed to Ron Conway's success, as it has led to numerous deal referrals.","(""One attribute that has contributed to investor Ron Conway's success in the startup world is his benevolence. Paul Graham writes that Ron Conway's power and influence in Silicon Valley are partly due to his reputation as a genuinely good person. Conway has been described as not just nice, but good in the sense that there are zero instances of him behaving badly. This character has made him a magnet for deal referrals, including from major companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. His good reputation makes people trust him, and his benevolent nature has contributed to becoming extremely powerful in the startup investment landscape. Furthermore, Graham notes that in the transparent and unpredictable world of startups, genuinely good behavior is essential because acting good without being good becomes increasingly difficult【9†source】."", ['No one, VC or angel, has invested in more of the top startups than Ron Conway. He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley, half the time because he arranged it. And yet he\'s a super nice guy. In fact, nice is not the word. Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved badly. It\'s hard even to imagine. When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought ""How lucky that someone so powerful is so benevolent."" But gradually I realized it wasn\'t luck. It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful. All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals. Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams himself. And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that he\'s proven himself to be a good guy. Good does not mean being a pushover. I would not want to face an angry Ronco. But if Ron\'s angry at you, it\'s because you did something wrong. Ron is so old school he\'s Old Testament. He will smite you in his just wrath, but there\'s no malice in it. In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good. It makes people trust you. But actually being good is an expensive way to seem good. To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill. In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world. Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among them: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding. [1]It was not always this way. I would not feel confident saying that about investors twenty years ago. What changed? The startup world became more transparent and more unpredictable. Both make it harder to seem good without actually being good. It\'s obvious why transparency has that effect. When an investor maltreats a founder now, it gets out. Maybe not all the way to the press, but other founders hear about it, and that investor starts to lose deals. [2]The effect of unpredictability is more subtle. It increases the work of being inconsistent. If you\'re going to be two-faced, you have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away with being nasty to. In the startup world, things change so rapidly that you can\'t tell. The random college kid you talk to today might in a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley. If you can\'t tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone. And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who are genuinely good. In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can\'t seem good without being good. As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the future by accident.

How has increased transparency in the startup world affected investor behavior?,"Increased transparency makes it difficult for investors to maltreat founders without it becoming known to others, which can lead to the loss of potential deals.","('Increased transparency in the startup world has had several effects on investor behavior. As founders become more powerful and able to sell some of their own stock in later rounds—a practice that is now fairly common—investors have found themselves adjusting to a different dynamics. Initially, many investors resisted the idea of founders selling their stock, but since the startup ecosystem has tolerated this practice well, it is becoming more prevalent and accepted.\n\nPaul Graham suggests that as founders gain more power, they could drive the startup world to be better for everyone, including investors. Founders often have a deeper understanding of their companies than investors, and therefore, it can be beneficial for the entire startup ecosystem if the people with the most knowledge, i.e., the founders, have more control. This change could mitigate overcontrolling tendencies of investors, which historically has been a source of stress for startup founders.\n\nAn analogy Graham uses is that of novice pilots overcontrolling an aircraft, causing it to oscillate rather than approach the desired state smoothly. If investors have less power and consequently interfere less, startups might perform better with founders who are more in control. As a result, even though investors may end up with less stock per startup, the overall number of successful startups could increase, which could benefit investors in the long-run.\n\nAnother significant aspect is the competition investors face not just among themselves but with conventional employers. If the investment process becomes less stressful for founders, starting a startup becomes more appealing compared to traditional employment, potentially leading to more people choosing to create startups over taking a job. This increase in the number of startups would be advantageous to investors because they would have more deals to choose from, ultimately compensating for any concessions made in the current climate of increased transparency and founder empowerment【7†source】.', [""The final thing founders want is to be able to sell some of their own stock in later rounds. This won't be a change, because the practice is now quite common. A lot of investors hated the idea, but the world hasn't exploded as a result, so it will happen more, and more openly. SurpriseI've talked here about a bunch of changes that will be forced on investors as founders become more powerful. Now the good news: investors may actually make more money as a result. A couple days ago an interviewer asked me if founders having more power would be better or worse for the world. I was surprised, because I'd never considered that question. Better or worse, it's happening. But after a second's reflection, the answer seemed obvious. Founders understand their companies better than investors, and it has to be better if the people with more knowledge have more power. One of the mistakes novice pilots make is overcontrolling the aircraft: applying corrections too vigorously, so the aircraft oscillates about the desired configuration instead of approaching it asymptotically. It seems probable that investors have till now on average been overcontrolling their portfolio companies. In a lot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders is not competitors but investors. Certainly it was for us at Viaweb. And this is not a new phenomenon: investors were James Watt's biggest problem too. If having less power prevents investors from overcontrolling startups, it should be better not just for founders but for investors too. Investors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups will probably do better with founders more in control, and there will almost certainly be more of them. Investors all compete with one another for deals, but they aren't one another's main competitor. Our main competitor is employers. And so far that competitor is crushing us. Only a tiny fraction of people who could start a startup do. Nearly all customers choose the competing product, a job. Why? Well, let's look at the product we're offering. An unbiased review would go something like this: Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to make a lot more money than a job, but it's also hard work and at times very stressful. Much of the stress comes from dealing with investors. If reforming the investment process removed that stress, we'd make our product much more attractive. The kind of people who make good startup founders don't mind dealing with technical problems—they enjoy technical problems—but they hate the type of problems investors cause. Investors have no idea that when they maltreat one startup, they're preventing 10 others from happening, but they are. Indirectly, but they are. So when investors stop trying to squeeze a little more out of their existing deals, they'll find they're net ahead, because so many more new deals appear""])",[],4.0

What should be the perceived improvement in a startup's average outcome for an investment to be considered beneficial when giving up 7% equity?,The investment should be considered beneficial if it improves the startup's average outcome by more than 7.5%.,"(""According to Paul Graham's essay on the equity equation, you should consider an investment beneficial and take the deal if you believe the investor can improve your startup's average outcome by more than 7.5%. This is calculated based on the fraction of the company you're giving up (in this case, 7% or 0.07). The formula used is that a good deal is one that makes the company worth more than 1/(1 - n), where n is the fraction of the company given up. For a 7% equity given up, the company's value must increase to make the remaining 93% (or 0.93) you hold worth more than the entire company before the deal【7†source】."", ['So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your average outcome by more than 7.5% If we improve your outcome by 10%, you\'re net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth .93 x 1.1 = 1.023. [1]One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal. Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company. 1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve your outcome by more than 43% For the average startup, that would be an extraordinary bargain. It would improve the average startup\'s prospects by more than 43% just to be able to say they were funded by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money. The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of the company they take is artificially low. They don\'t even try to get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still theirs. The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are 1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups. Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal. It\'s never just a straight trade of money for stock. But if it were, taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain. You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other direction. If i is the average outcome for the company with the addition of some new person, then they\'re worth n such that i = 1/(1 - n) Which means n = (i - 1)/i. For example, suppose you\'re just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker who\'s so good you feel he\'ll increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20% n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = .167. So you\'ll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company for him. That doesn\'t mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there\'s usually salary and overhead as well. And if the company merely breaks even on the deal, there\'s no reason to do it. I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about 1.5. Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don\'t have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast you\'ll be paying next year\'s salary out of next year\'s valuation, which should be 3x this year\'s. If your valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a new hire\'s salary and overhead is 1.5 years\' cost at the present valuation. [2]How much of an additional margin should the company need as the ""activation energy"" for the deal? Since this is in effect the company\'s profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if you\'re a hot opportunity, you can charge more. Let\'s run through an example. Suppose the company wants to make a ""profit"" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. So subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his ""retail"" price.\n# 【1†all_essays_in_single_file.txt†file-46kK48uGkF2wHFTlIyEdGO2v】\nIn many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would be enough.[4] Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on e. g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like casual conversation. The threshold may be whether what you write has a title.\n\nThanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Written by Paul Graham\n\nThe Equity Equation\n\nJuly 2007\n\nAn investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage of your startup. Should you take it? You\'re about to hire your first employee. How much stock should you give him?These are some of the hardest questions founders face. And yet both have the same answer:1/(1 - n)Whenever you\'re trading stock in your company for anything, whether it\'s money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test for whether to do it is the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before. For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for you to break even? Obviously it has to double: if you trade half your company for something that more than doubles the company\'s average outcome, you\'re net ahead. You have half as big a share of something worth more than twice as much. In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you\'re giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth more than 1/(1 - n'])",[],5.0

There are plenty of people as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing. In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination starts to look like talent. I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but the relative importance of determination and talent probably do vary somewhat. Talent probably matters more in types of work that are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type of problem instead of many different types. I suspect determination would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized crime. I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that depend more on talent are always more admirable. Most people would agree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural ability. Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups than it used to in earlier types of companies.

What are the two most important things to understand about startup investing?,The two most important things to understand are that almost all returns are concentrated in a few big winners and that the best ideas initially look like bad ideas.,"(""The two most important things to understand about startup investing, according to Paul Graham, are the importance of having formidable founders and the startup's plausible path to owning a big piece of a big market【7†source】. Formidable founders are crucial as investors often decide within the first few minutes whether they seem like winners or losers, and this first impression is hard to change. A startup is a sufficiently good bet for investors not necessarily when it's guaranteed to succeed but when it has formidable founders paired with a plausible path to significant market ownership【7†source】."", ['The most important ingredient is formidable founders. Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it\'s hard to change. [2] Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest. If investors think you\'re a winner they focus on the former, and if not they focus on the latter. For example, it might be a rich market, but with a slow sales cycle. If investors are impressed with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it\'s a rich market, and if not, they say they can\'t invest because of the slow sales cycle. They\'re not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike startups. If you seem like a winner, they\'ll like your idea more. But don\'t be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you have it too; almost everyone does. There is a role for ideas of course. They\'re fuel for the fire that starts with liking the founders. Once investors like you, you\'ll see them reaching for ideas: they\'ll be saying ""yes, and you could also do x."" (Whereas when they don\'t like you, they\'ll be saying ""but what about y?"")But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable, and since this isn\'t a word most people use in conversation much, I should explain what it means. A formidable person is one who seems like they\'ll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident. There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming formidable — some because they actually are very formidable and just let it show, and others because they are more or less con artists. [3] But most founders, including many who will go on to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming formidable the first time they try fundraising. What should they do? [4]What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders. Investors are not always that good at judging technology, but they\'re good at judging confidence. If you try to act like something you\'re not, you\'ll just end up in an uncanny valley. You\'ll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing. TruthThe way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth. How formidable you seem isn\'t a constant. It varies depending on what you\'re saying. Most people can seem confident when they\'re saying ""one plus one is two,"" because they know it\'s true. The most diffident person would be puzzled and even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC ""one plus one is two"" and the VC reacted with skepticism. The magic ability of people who are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with the sentence ""we\'re going to make a billion dollars a year."" But you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first. That\'s the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they\'ll believe you. And by convince yourself, I don\'t mean play mind games with yourself to boost your confidence. I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn\'t, don\'t try to raise money.\n# 【1†all_essays_in_single_file.txt†file-46kK48uGkF2wHFTlIyEdGO2v】\nI mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn\'t, don\'t try to raise money. [5] But if it is, you\'ll be telling the truth when you tell investors it\'s worth investing in, and they\'ll sense that. You don\'t have to be a smooth presenter if you understand something well and tell the truth about it. To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert. If you\'re not a domain expert, you can be as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Which in fact it will usually be. And investors can tell fairly quickly whether you\'re a domain expert by how well you answer their questions. Know everything about your market. [6]Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things they\'re not convinced of themselves? Partly because we\'ve all been trained to. When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad school, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of a question from their faculty advisor that we still quote today. When the unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst out: Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe? One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we all get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say. If you have a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if you only have one page of ideas. Even if you have no ideas. You have to produce something. And all too many startups go into fundraising in the same spirit. When they think it\'s time to raise money, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their startup. Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whether what they\'re saying is actually convincing, because they\'ve all been trained to treat the need to present as a given — as an area of fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs be spread, however thinly. The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach some artificial deadline like a Demo Day. It\'s when you can convince investors, and not before. [7]And unless you\'re a good con artist, you\'ll never convince investors if you\'re not convinced yourself. They\'re far better at detecting bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you\'re producing it unknowingly. If you try to convince investors before you\'ve convinced yourself, you\'ll be wasting both your time. But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time. It will force you to organize your thoughts. To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you\'ll have to figure out why it\'s worth investing in. And if you can do that you\'ll end up with more than added confidence. You\'ll also have a provisional roadmap of how to succeed. MarketNotice I\'ve been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth investing in, rather than whether it\'s going to succeed. No one knows whether a startup is going to succeed. And it\'s a good thing for investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance whether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be the future price, and there would be no room for investors to make money. Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and against pretty long odds. So to prove you\'re worth investing in, you don\'t have to prove you\'re going to succeed, just that you\'re a sufficiently good bet. What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet? In addition to formidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big piece of a big market', 'The most important ingredient is formidable founders. Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it\'s hard to change. [2] Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest. If investors think you\'re a winner they focus on the former, and if not they focus on the latter. For example, it might be a rich market, but with a slow sales cycle. If investors are impressed with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it\'s a rich market, and if not, they say they can\'t invest because of the slow sales cycle. They\'re not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike startups. If you seem like a winner, they\'ll like your idea more. But don\'t be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you have it too; almost everyone does. There is a role for ideas of course. They\'re fuel for the fire that starts with liking the founders. Once investors like you, you\'ll see them reaching for ideas: they\'ll be saying ""yes, and you could also do x."" (Whereas when they don\'t like you, they\'ll be saying ""but what about y?"")But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable, and since this isn\'t a word most people use in conversation much, I should explain what it means. A formidable person is one who seems like they\'ll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident. There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming formidable — some because they actually are very formidable and just let it show, and others because they are more or less con artists.

Why is it difficult for investors to grasp the magnitude of success possible with startups?,"It is difficult because the big winners in startup investing can be big to a degree that violates our normal expectations about variation, leading to 1000x variation in outcomes, which most people are not prepared for.","(""According to Paul Graham, it is difficult for investors to grasp the magnitude of success possible with startups because of two key reasons:\n\n1. **Concentration of Returns**: Effectively all of the returns in startup investing are concentrated in a few big winners. The disparity between the winners and the rest can be so vast that it often violates what investors might expect based on normal variation. Graham realized this firsthand, noticing that of the approximate $10 billion value of the companies Y Combinator had funded, around three quarters of that value came from just two companies, Dropbox and Airbnb【7†source】.\n\n2. **Counterintuitive Quality of Successful Ideas**: The best startup ideas often appear bad initially. They don't fit within the established framework of what is traditionally considered a good idea, which can lead to skepticism and misunderstanding among investors who are looking for more sure bets【7†source】.\n\nThese factors contribute to the difficulty that investors, even experienced ones, have in recognizing and betting on the startups that could potentially yield massive returns."", [""The two most important things to understand about startup investing, as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look initially like bad ideas. The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn't really grasp till it happened to us. The total value of the companies we've funded is around 10 billion, give or take a few.

What is the main reason for the increasing number of startups according to Paul Graham?,The main reason for the increasing number of startups is that it has become cheaper to start web startups.,"(""According to Paul Graham, the main reason for the increasing number of startups is that it's cheaper to start a startup now than it was in the past. He states that technology has driven down the cost of building products and acquiring customers【7†source】."", [""Part of the reason it's getting easier to start a startup is social. Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers. The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the balance of power between founders and investors""])",[],5.0
How might the attitude of big companies towards acquisitions change in the future?,Big companies might start to develop standardized procedures making acquisitions almost as simple as hiring someone.,"('According to Paul Graham, big companies that are large enough to purchase startups tend to be quite conservative, especially the people in charge of acquisitions. These individuals often prefer overpaying for a ""safe choice"" rather than taking on the risks associated with early-stage startups【9†source】.\n\nBased on this attitude, the future stance of big companies towards acquisitions could lean towards a few possible directions:\n\n1. Established Startup Focus: They may continue to favor acquiring more established startups, which have proven their market value and present a lower risk compared to early-stage startups. \n\n2. Conservative Acquisitions: Larger companies might maintain a conservative approach, largely due to their organizational structure and the typical risk aversion of those in charge of acquisitions.\n\n3. Competitive Pressures: These companies could be motivated by the fear of missing out, especially if there\'s a possibility that a competitor might acquire a certain startup. This fear of loss may drive them to acquire startups more aggressively if it seems like the startup could either enhance a competitor\'s position or grow to be a formidable competitor itself.\n\n4. Timing and Valuation Concerns: Big companies may also be concerned that if they don\'t act quickly enough, the cost of acquisition might rise as the company continues to grow. This could potentially prompt earlier acquisitions or at least motivate big companies to monitor startups more closely, gauging the perfect time to make an offer.', [""A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one. Get UsersI think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It's also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client's assets into one volatile stock?How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master. Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor""])",[],2.0
What change in founders' behavior might occur if it becomes more common to start a startup immediately after college?,Students may focus on collaborating with peers they want as cofounders instead of securing internships at established companies.,"('Graduating seniors traditionally had two options: get a job or go to grad school. However, Paul Graham discusses how there may increasingly be a third option: to start your own startup【9†source】. As this becomes more common, graduates might start considering entrepreneurship right after college as a viable and regular path, similarly to how they view job search or further education.\n\nIn the essay, Graham observes that during the late 90s, undergraduates were frequently going to work for startups right away, and he suggests that a similar situation might return – with the twist that graduates may now be more inclined to start their own ventures immediately after finishing college.\n\nThe change in the behavior of founders who choose to start a startup immediately after college might include coping without a ""huge excuse for failing."" Graham suggests that after graduation, there is a shift in how an individual is perceived – from being a student to being identified with their chosen profession, like being a programmer or a startup founder. If one starts a startup right after college, the undertaking is seen as their occupation, and thus they have a higher pressure to succeed, as the opinion of peers becomes a powerful motivator. In contrast, starting a startup while in college can be perceived as more of a side project or summer job, which doesn\'t carry the same level of expectation or scrutiny【9†source】.\n\nFurthermore, the usual youthful advantages of stamina, poverty (living cheaply), rootlessness, having colleagues of the same age, and a certain helpful ignorance could be forces that drive newly graduated founders. Young founders often work exceptionally long hours and are probably less efficient than more experienced individuals, making these long hours particularly necessary【9†source】.\n\nMoreover, by starting a startup immediately after college, founders would capitalize on their youth, with its unique strengths, before reaching what Graham refers to as the ""sweet spot"" for startup founders in their mid-twenties【9†source】.', ['Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go to grad school. I think there will increasingly be a third option: to start your own startup. But how common will that be?I\'m sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a startup could well become as popular as grad school. In the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn\'t get grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for startups. I wouldn\'t be surprised if that situation returns, but with one difference: this time they\'ll be starting their own instead of going to work for other people\'s. The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not start a startup while you\'re in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup instead?A year and a half ago I gave a talk where I said that the average age of the founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could start startups, why not undergrads? I\'m glad I phrased that as a question, because now I can pretend it wasn\'t merely a rhetorical one. At the time I couldn\'t imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of startup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic change, not a biological one. And certainly there are undergrads as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn\'t undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. Regardless of how complex your life is, you\'ll find that everyone else, including your family and friends, will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single occupation at any given time. If you\'re in college and have a summer job writing software, you still read as a student. Whereas if you graduate and get a job programming, you\'ll be instantly regarded by everyone as a programmer. The problem with starting a startup while you\'re still in school is that there\'s a built-in escape hatch. If you start a startup in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to everyone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your occupation is student, and you didn\'t fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you graduate, as long as you\'re not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your occupation. You\'re now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that. For nearly everyone, the opinion of one\'s peers is the most powerful motivator of all—more powerful even than the nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. [1] About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they\'ve got so far. You might think they wouldn\'t need any more motivation. They\'re working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they\'re playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You\'d think that would be motivation enough. And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity. Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time. What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad. You probably can\'t change that. Even if you could, I don\'t think you\'d want to; someone who really, truly doesn\'t care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly. If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a direction you like. Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so hard that it\'s a close call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway. Within about three minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking ""Ah, so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19.""If it can work to start a startup during college, why do we tell people not to?

Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well as talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice for everyone. The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and the ones who are sufficiently determined think ""screw that, I\'ll succeed anyway.""So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can\'t talk out of it. And frankly, if you\'re not certain, you should wait. It\'s not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going to be gone if you don\'t do it now. Maybe the window will close on some idea you\'re working on, but that won\'t be the last idea you\'ll have. For every idea that times out, new ones become feasible. Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increased with time. In that case, you might ask, why not wait longer? Why not go work for a while, or go to grad school, and then start a startup? And indeed, that might be a good idea.

For nearly everyone, the opinion of one\'s peers is the most powerful motivator of all—more powerful even than the nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. [1] About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they\'ve got so far. You might think they wouldn\'t need any more motivation. They\'re working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they\'re playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You\'d think that would be motivation enough. And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity. Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time. What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad. You probably can\'t change that. Even if you could, I don\'t think you\'d want to; someone who really, truly doesn\'t care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly. If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a direction you like. Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so hard that it\'s a close call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway. Within about three minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking ""Ah, so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19.""If it can work to start a startup during college, why do we tell people not to? For the same reason that the probably apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone\'s playing, would always say they didn\'t have enough talent to make it as a pro. Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well as talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice for everyone. The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and the ones who are sufficiently determined think ""screw that, I\'ll succeed anyway.""So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can\'t talk out of it. And frankly, if you\'re not certain, you should wait. It\'s not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going to be gone if you don\'t do it now. Maybe the window will close on some idea you\'re working on, but that won\'t be the last idea you\'ll have. For every idea that times out, new ones become feasible. Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increased with time. In that case, you might ask, why not wait longer? Why not go work for a while, or go to grad school, and then start a startup? And indeed, that might be a good idea. If I had to pick the sweet spot for startup founders, based on who we\'re most excited to see applications from, I\'d say it\'s probably the mid-twenties', 'Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go to grad school. I think there will increasingly be a third option: to start your own startup. But how common will that be?I\'m sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a startup could well become as popular as grad school. In the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn\'t get grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for startups. I wouldn\'t be surprised if that situation returns, but with one difference: this time they\'ll be starting their own instead of going to work for other people\'s. The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not start a startup while you\'re in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup instead?A year and a half ago I gave a talk where I said that the average age of the founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could start startups, why not undergrads? I\'m glad I phrased that as a question, because now I can pretend it wasn\'t merely a rhetorical one. At the time I couldn\'t imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of startup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic change, not a biological one. And certainly there are undergrads as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn\'t undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. Regardless of how complex your life is, you\'ll find that everyone else, including your family and friends, will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single occupation at any given time. If you\'re in college and have a summer job writing software, you still read as a student. Whereas if you graduate and get a job programming, you\'ll be instantly regarded by everyone as a programmer. The problem with starting a startup while you\'re still in school is that there\'s a built-in escape hatch. If you start a startup in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to everyone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your occupation is student, and you didn\'t fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you graduate, as long as you\'re not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your occupation.
