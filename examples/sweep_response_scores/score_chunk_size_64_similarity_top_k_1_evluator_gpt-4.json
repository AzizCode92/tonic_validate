      "llm_answer": "The problem with business culture versus start-up culture with respect to productivity is that conventional ideas of professionalism, which are deeply ingrained in our minds, tend to hinder productivity in big companies. Start-ups, on the other hand, often prioritize efficiency and innovation over traditional notions of professionalism. This can lead to a more dynamic and productive work environment in start-ups compared to larger companies.",

      "reference_answer": "During board meetings, matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote, not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous. If opinion is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose in a vote tends to be less insistent. This is what board control means in practice.",
      "llm_answer": "Board control for startups refers to the level of influence and decision-making power that founders have over the company's board of directors. It means that founders have the ability to shape the direction and strategy of the company, as well as make key decisions regarding its operations and future. This level of control can significantly impact the overall dynamics and culture within the startup, as it affects how decisions are made and how the company is managed.",
      "retrieved_context": [
        "So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary either.There's inevitably a difference in how things feel within the company.Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to retain board control after a series A, that will change the way things feel in the whole startup world."

VCs do not want to look like they've lost a negotiation. If founders keeping control after a series A is the norm, then it happening will not look like the VCs lost the negotiation.",

        "In a dozen companies we've funded, the founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series A round.I feel like we're at a tipping point here.A lot of VCs still act as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of."
