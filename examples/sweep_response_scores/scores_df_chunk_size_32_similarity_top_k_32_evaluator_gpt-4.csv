This is what board control means in practice.","Board control for startups refers to the ability of the founders to retain control over the board of directors after a series A round of funding. This means that the founders have the majority of board seats and can make decisions that are in the best interest of the shareholders. While it does not give the founders total control, it allows them to have a significant influence on the direction and decision-making of the company.","[""That's what board control means in practice."", 'Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to retain board control after a series A, that will change the way things feel in the whole startup world.', ""and asked me how common it was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board after a series A round."", 'Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help VCs pick better.', 'A lot of VCs still act as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.', ""then your opinion about what's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary either."", 'Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply outvoting other parties in board meetings.', 'In the past, founders rarely kept control of the board through a series A.', 'But are these just outliers?How common is it for founders to keep control after an A round?', 'Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it will become the norm.', 'The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.', ""A lot of them don't care that much personally about whether founders keep board control.They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions."", 'The traditional series A board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.', ""In a dozen companies we've funded, the founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series A round."", 'Founder Control\n\nDecember 2010\n\nWant to start a startup?Get funded by Y Combinator.', 'Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.', 'People do in startups, at least some of the time.', 'Investors usually get vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless of how many board seats they have.And board votes are rarely split.', ""and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.How would the government decide who's a startup investor?"", 'But seeing what startups are really like will at least show other organizations what to aim for.', 'Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be.', 'DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startup founders.', ""Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board through the series A and still has it today.Mark Pincus has kept control of Zynga's too."", 'And yet conventional ideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are affected by them.', 'people producing thick reports for one another to read.Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.', 'but if you have a majority of board seats,', 'More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one independent.In either case the founders lose their majority.But not always.', ""When you're starting a startup that depends on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're trying to ignore you out of existence."", ""They're doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big, bureaucratic companies."", 'Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.', 'only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first year of a startup.This is what real productivity looks like.', 'The world of startups is so unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the fly.']",3.0,0.3125,0.1,0.03125,1.0,0.40875000000000006
What's in the way of founders keeping board control after a series A?,"The perception that founders keeping board control after a series A being a concession a VC has made when negotiating with startups. VCs do not want to look like they've lost a negotiation. If founders keeping control after a series A is the norm, then it happening will not look like the VCs lost the negotiation.","The traditional structure of a series A board, consisting of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member, often results in founders losing their majority control. However, in some cases, founders are able to retain control of the board even after a series A round. The resistance to founders keeping board control may stem from VCs not wanting to appear as if they had to make concessions. However, if the perception of letting founders keep control changes, it is likely to become more common for founders to retain board control after a series A.","['A lot of VCs still act as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.', ""and asked me how common it was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board after a series A round."", 'In the past, founders rarely kept control of the board through a series A.', 'Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it will become the norm.', 'Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to retain board control after a series A, that will change the way things feel in the whole startup world.', 'But are these just outliers?How common is it for founders to keep control after an A round?', ""In a dozen companies we've funded, the founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series A round."", 'Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help VCs pick better.', 'The traditional series A board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.', ""A lot of them don't care that much personally about whether founders keep board control.They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions."", ""Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board through the series A and still has it today.Mark Pincus has kept control of Zynga's too."", 'More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one independent.In either case the founders lose their majority.But not always.', ""But the founders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks."", 'Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply outvoting other parties in board meetings.', 'Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.', ""That's what board control means in practice."", ""Why It's Safe for Founders to Be"", ""If they know they can't fire the founders, they'll have to choose founders they can trust.And that's who they should have been choosing all along."", 'but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.', 'Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be.', 'Investors usually get vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless of how many board seats they have.And board votes are rarely split.', 'The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.', 'Or if they are, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control freaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.', 'Founder Control\n\nDecember 2010\n\nWant to start a startup?Get funded by Y Combinator.', 'DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startup founders.', ""They're the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs."", ""Notes[1] Many think successful startup founders are driven by money.In fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that they aren't."", ""As I've written before, one of the things that has surprised me most about startups is how few of the most successful founders are like that."", ""then your opinion about what's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary either."", 'What drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives most people who make things: the company is their project.', ""And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.But as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination."", ""Sam AltmanI was told I shouldn't mention founders of YC-funded companies in this list.""]",4.0,0.25,0.375,0.21875,1.0,0.5287499999999999
