Additionally, the text suggests that he is highly regarded when it comes to advising startups, particularly in the areas of design, strategy, and ambition.

Start-ups, on the other hand, have a different approach to productivity and do not adhere to traditional notions of professionalism. The effort put into looking productive, such as dressing in suits and producing thick reports, is not only wasted but actually makes organizations less productive.
