In contrast, start-ups, especially in their early stages, prioritize real productivity over looking productive. Start-ups are not burdened by the need to produce thick reports or engage in activities that do not directly contribute to productivity. This difference in approach allows start-ups to be more efficient and effective in their operations. As a result, there is a growing recognition that corporations can benefit from adopting some of the characteristics of start-up culture to enhance their own productivity.",
