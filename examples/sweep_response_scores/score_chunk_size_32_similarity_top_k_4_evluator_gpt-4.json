      "question": "For startups, what does board control mean in practice?",
      "reference_answer": "During board meetings, matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote, not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous. If opinion is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose in a vote tends to be less insistent. This is what board control means in practice.",

VCs do not want to look like they've lost a negotiation. If founders keeping control after a series A is the norm, then it happening will not look like the VCs lost the negotiation.",
      "llm_answer": "There may be several factors that can hinder founders from retaining board control after a series A round. These factors could include the preferences and demands of venture capitalists (VCs) who typically invest in series A rounds. VCs often seek to have a say in the decision-making process and may want to have a significant influence on the board to protect their investment. Additionally, VCs may have more experience and expertise in scaling and growing companies, which they believe can be beneficial for the startup's success. Therefore, it is not uncommon for VCs to negotiate for board control in order to have a greater say in the company's strategic direction.",
