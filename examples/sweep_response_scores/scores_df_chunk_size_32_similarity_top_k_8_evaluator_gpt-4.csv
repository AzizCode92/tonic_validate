What is the problem with business culture versus start up culture with respect to productivity?,"In business culture, energy is expended on outward appearance to the detriment of productivity, while in startup culture there is no value of appearance it's all about productivity.","The problem with business culture versus start-up culture with respect to productivity is that conventional ideas of professionalism, which are deeply ingrained in our minds, hinder productivity in big companies. In contrast, start-ups, especially in their early stages, prioritize real productivity over looking productive. Start-ups are not burdened by the need to produce thick reports or engage in activities that do not directly contribute to productivity. This difference in approach allows start-ups to be more efficient and effective in their operations.
