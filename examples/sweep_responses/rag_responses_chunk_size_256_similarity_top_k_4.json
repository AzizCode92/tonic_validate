Altman can't be stopped by such flimsy rules.If he wants to be on this list, he's going to be.Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to most when I'm advising startups.On questions of design, I ask \"What would Steve do?\"but on questions of strategy or ambition I ask \"What would Sama do?\"What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect applies to startups.It applies way less than most people think: startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the way you might in a horse race.But there are a few people with such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want.", "Sam Altman of Loopt is one of the most successful alumni, so we asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application that would help us

the relationship between the founders has to be strong.They must genuinely like one another, and work well together.Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be.Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of Justin.tv are a good example of close friends who work well together.They've known each other since second grade.They can practically

talking to companies we fund?Who do I find myself quoting?1.Steve JobsI'd guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but for most people you could ask.A lot of startup culture is Apple culture.He was the original young founder.And while the concept of \"insanely great\" already existed in the arts, it was a novel idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.More remarkable still, he's stayed interesting for 30 years.People await new Apple products the way they'd await new books by a popular novelist.Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn't happen if he weren't CEO.Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.What makes him unique is his sense of design.Before him, most companies treated design as a frivolous extra.Apple's competitors now know better.2.", "TJ RodgersTJ Rodgers isn't as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the best writer among Silicon Valley CEOs.I've probably learned more from him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else.Not so much from specific things he's written as by reconstructing the mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collecting outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I remember exactly where I was at the time.It was High Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?and I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.It felt as if someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.3.Larry & SergeyI'm sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one

something so great that people recommend it to their friends.And being rapacious not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts.[3]The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself that will both make you happy and make your company successful.Tell yourself you can be

While intelligence is also important, as long as founders meet a certain threshold of intelligence, determination becomes the deciding factor. Startups often face numerous obstacles and setbacks, and founders need to be resilient and not easily demoralized. This quality allows founders to persist and find solutions to problems, ultimately increasing their chances of success.", "retrieved_context": ["What We Look for in Founders\n\nOctober 2010\n\nWant to start a startup?Get funded by Y Combinator.(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something about the qualities we look for in founders.In print they had to cut the last item because they didn't have room.)1.DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startup founders.We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most important quality would be intelligence.That's the myth in the Valley.And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.But as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination.You're going to hit a lot of obstacles.You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay are a good example.They're doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big, bureaucratic companies.When you're starting a startup that depends on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're trying to ignore you out of existence.But when Bill Clerico starts calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not going away.2.", "FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases like \"don't give up on your dreams.\"The world of startups is so unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the fly.The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination and flexibility you need is a running back.He's determined to get downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or even backwards to get there.The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of Greplin.He applied to YC with some bad ecommerce idea.We told him we'd fund him if he did something else.He thought for a second, and said ok.He then went through two more ideas before settling on Greplin.He'd only been working on it for a couple days when he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.He always seems to land on his feet.3.ImaginationIntelligence does matter a lot of course.It seems like the type that matters most is imagination.It's not so important to be able to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with surprising new ideas.In the startup world, most good ideas seem bad initially.", "Notes[1] Many think successful startup founders are driven by money.In fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that they aren't.If they were, they'd have taken one of the acquisition offers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up.What drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives most people who make things: the company is their project.[2] In fact since 2 \u2248 1.05 ^ 15, the un-rapacious founder is always 15 weeks behind the rapacious one.[3] The other reason it might help to be good at squeezing money out of customers is that startups usually lose money at first, and making more per customer makes it easier to get to profitability before your initial funding runs out.But while it is very common for startups to die from running through their initial funding and then being unable to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money from existing customers.Thanks to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this, and to Randall Bennett for being such a nice guy.", "Learning from Founders\n\nJanuary 2007\n\n(Foreword to Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work.)Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.The winners slow down the least.It's that way with most startups too.The earliest phase is usually the most productive.That's when they have the really big ideas.Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different from most people's idea of what business is like.If you looked in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing \"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to read.Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.And yet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy.Why the disconnect?I think there's a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate.More often than not the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse."]}, {"question": "For startups, what does board control mean in
