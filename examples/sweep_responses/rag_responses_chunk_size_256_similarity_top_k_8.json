since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country

law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.Each year.They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.By

great things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself that will both make you happy and make your company successful.Tell yourself you can be

where it would help to be rapacious is when growth depends on that.What makes startups different is that usually it doesn't.Startups usually win by making something so great that people recommend it to their friends.And being rapacious not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts.[3]The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself that will both make you happy and make your company successful.Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work

profitability before your initial funding runs out.But while it is very common for startups to die from running through their initial funding and then being unable to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money from existing customers.Thanks to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for

quoting?1.Steve JobsI'd guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but for most people you could ask.A lot of startup culture is Apple culture.He was the original young founder.And while the concept of \"insanely great\" already existed in the arts, it was a novel idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.More remarkable still, he's stayed interesting for 30 years.People await new Apple products the way they'd await new books by a popular novelist.Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn't happen if he weren't CEO.Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.What makes him unique is his sense of design.Before him, most companies treated design as a frivolous extra.Apple's competitors now know better.2."]}, {"question": "For

While board control does not equate to total control, it does give founders the ability to shape the direction of the company and have their opinions on what is in the best interest of the shareholders prevail. Board control also means that founders have the power to set the trends and norms within the startup world, as well as choose the investors they can trust.", "retrieved_context": ["You don't simply

the norm for founders to retain board control after a series A, that will change the way things feel in the whole startup world.The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.They're the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups is
