aggressively garbage-collecting outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I remember exactly where I was at the time.It was High Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?and I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.It felt as if someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.3.Larry & SergeyI'm sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person.I've always thought that was unfair to them.But it does seem as if Google was a collaboration.Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it was important to have the best hackers.So they claimed, at least.But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before."]}, {"question": "When does the most dramatic growth happen for a startup?", "reference_answer": "When the startup only has three or four people.", "llm_answer": "The most dramatic growth for a startup happens when it only has three or four people.", "retrieved_context": ["The really dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people, so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands see business as it's practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first year of a startup.This is what real productivity looks like.This is the Formula 1 racecar.It looks weird, but it goes fast.Of course, big companies won't be able to do everything these startups do.In big companies there's always going to be more politics, and less scope for individual decisions.But seeing what startups are really like will at least show other organizations what to aim for.The time may soon be coming when instead of startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to seem more like startups.That would be a good thing.Japanese Translation.", "Learning from Founders\n\nJanuary 2007\n\n(Foreword to Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work.)Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.The winners slow down the least.It's that way with most startups too.The earliest phase is usually the most productive.That's when they have the really big ideas.Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different from most people's idea of what business is like.If you looked in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing \"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to read.Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.And yet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy.Why the disconnect?I think there's a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate.More often than not the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse."]}, {"question": "What is the problem with business culture versus start up culture with respect to productivity?", "reference_answer": "In business culture, energy is expended on outward appearance to the detriment of productivity, while in startup culture there is no value of appearance it's all about productivity.", "llm_answer": "The problem with business culture versus start-up culture with respect to productivity is that business culture tends to prioritize appearances and looking productive rather than actually being productive.
